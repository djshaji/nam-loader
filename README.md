## Latency
The app runs at native device sample rate and uses the Google Oboe Library.
It processes audio through a native callback mechanism. The audio samples 
sent to the app via Oboe's callback are directly processed by the plugin 
engine and sent back. It means that the app adds no latency of its own. Even
low end devices should be able to run NAM models easily.
